<h2>How to use DAS?</h2>

<div>
    <p>
        To use the Document Application System you must be an adult.
        This implies that you are already registered as a regular citizen of your municipality.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        First step is to visit your municipality office and make a request to use DAS. By doing this
        you will get your unique identification number (different from ID number). It will serve as
        identification key in your submitted forms, beside personal informations.
    </p><br />
    <p>
        You are allowed to request a document for yourself and for your children, only if your children
        are younger than 18, there are not adults.<br />You are not allowed to issue a document in behalf
        of another person, neither close relatives nor complete stranger. However, the last statement is
        not valid if you have a written permission given by that person.
